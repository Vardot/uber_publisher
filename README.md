### Steps for reating a new subprofile from varbase:
1. Copy entire directory and rename directory, profile, install and info just like any module.
2. Edit files in configbit and add any additional components you need.
3. Edit src/Form/AssemblerForm and replace profile name in getSelectedExtraComponents and getExtraComponentsInfo (this need to be revamped for a better solution).
