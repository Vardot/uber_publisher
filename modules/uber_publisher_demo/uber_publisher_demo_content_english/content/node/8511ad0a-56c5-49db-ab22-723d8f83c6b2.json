We need to keep pushing on and hopefully catch up with our rivals. Alav\u00e9s are a strong team at home and I think they can create a lot of problems for teams if they continue to play this way\u201d.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>\u201cWe're not great in front of goal but the important is that we create chances in front of goal. We need to close games off quicker. We have many games ahead of us. If we all pull in the same direction we can move forward as a unit\u201d.<br \/>\r\n&nbsp;<br \/>\r\n<strong>Starting the game<\/strong><br \/>\r\n\u201cI worked hard for this moment to come. I never give up and have always kept working harder and harder to achieve what I did today. I need to keep working hard\u201d.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<strong>Nacho: \u201cWe dominated&nbsp;the game\u201d<\/strong><br \/>\r\n\u201cWe dominated well considering this is a tough place to come, and they really put the pressure on, but we had some key chances and fortunately we got the three points, that is the most important thing\u201d<br \/>\r\n&nbsp;<br \/>\r\n\u201cPerhaps that is what we\u2019re lacking, in previous years it came to easier than this. It's virtually the same group of players and our attackers are amongst the best in the world, and that's why there's no reason for us to be concerned\".<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"We work really hard throughout the whole year. We had a perfect season last time round and there are no doubts at all within the camp. We've got a really committed group and we work very hard. Whilst we might not have got the results we wanted to, there are no question marks\".<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<strong>Varane: \"The important thing are the three points\"<\/strong><br \/>\r\n\"The important thing was to get the three points. We know that we've dropped points at home and we needed to produce a reaction and give a good account of ourselves. They played well and with just a few chances they managed to create some danger. We're lacking in our own box and in the opposition's area when it comes to killing games off, controlling the game better and playing with more quality\".<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n\"In these last few games we've struggled to find the net, but these things happen in football. We must continue to be relaxed because we've got the quality to win games and be in a good position come the end of the season. We've all got to work together\".<br \/>\r\n&nbsp;<br \/>\r\n<strong>Llorente: \"We know what we're capable of doing\"<\/strong><br \/>\r\n\"That's the way things go in football, sometimes everything you hit goes in and on other occasions that's not the case, but we'll keep on working hard to make sure that we put away the chances we're failing to take at the moment. We're very sure of ourselves and know what we're capable of doing. We've picked up the three points, which is the main thing. We knew that you really have to dig in here and it was a hard-fought game.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n\"We all need to be ready to take any opportunities that the coach hands up and when you're called on you have to be at 100% and perform to the standard that's expected at this club. We have to work hard and make the most of the opportunities we're given\".<br \/>\r\n&nbsp;<br \/>\r\n<strong>Reception in Vitoria<\/strong><br \/>\r\n\"It was incredible to get a reception like that on my return to Mendizorroza.I wasn't expecting it. I'll forever be grateful to this club, its fans and the city. Alav\u00e9s have got a new team and they still need to get used to each other. They haven't got off to a good start, but as the games progress, they're looking better and they performed well today\".<\/p>\r\n",
