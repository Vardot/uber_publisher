For example, her series&nbsp;<i>Erbgericht<\/i>,&nbsp;tells the story of an old guesthouse located in the German&nbsp;village of Polenz, detailing the memories of members of the family who have owned the building since 1889.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>\u201cShe plays with colors in her work, grounded in elements of surrealism,\u201d the jury\u2014which this year was comprised of photographer Maryam Eisler; founder of Prix Pictet and former head of photographs at Sotheby\u2019s, Francis Hodgson; photographer Dana Lixenberg; professor Anna-Kaisa Rastenberger; and Cond\u00e9 Nast International editor-in-chief, Darius Sanai\u2014said in a statement. The award comes with a healthy \u20ac10,000 prize to fund a new project.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meanwhile, for his work&nbsp;<i>\u00c9conomie de march\u00e9 (Market economy),&nbsp;<\/i>French photographer Robin Lopvet received the Public Prize, which was determined from the results of an online poll. He has been commissioned to create a new work for the ING collection.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>All five nominees for the award were given the opportunity to work with British artist Nadav Kander for what was billed as an extensive Talent Program that included online coaching sessions and workshops as well as introductions to professionals in the photography world.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Previous winners&nbsp;of the ING Unseen Talent Awards include Thomas Albdorf,&nbsp;Miren Pastor, Sophie Jung,&nbsp;Lara Gasparotto, Anne Geene,&nbsp;Maurice van Es,&nbsp;and Ola Lanko.<\/p>\r\n",
