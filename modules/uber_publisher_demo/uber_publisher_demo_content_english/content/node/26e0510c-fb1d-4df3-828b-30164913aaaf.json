In the black-and-white images, a stark,&nbsp;gridded backdrop is a direct reference to Muybridge\u2019s style of scientific photography.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kriemler reached out to Graham, and a collaboration was born. \u201c[Albert] seemed to have a genuine interest in the work, and I just intuitively trusted him,\u201d the Canadian artist says in the Akris video.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The various frames of the dramatic black-and-white series form a key part of Akris\u2019s&nbsp;Fall-Winter 2017-2018 collection: The freeze frames, complete with the Muybridge-esque grids, have been emblazoned on handbags, scarves, and, of course, overcoats\u2014putting pictures of coats on coats. The collection\u2019s marquee coat continues the theme, showcasing in full detail the work that first sparked Kriemler\u2019s imagination, Graham\u2019s&nbsp;<em>Coat Puller.&nbsp;<\/em><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The&nbsp;collection\u2019s launch event climaxed with six models clad in Kriemler\u2019s coats, arriving at the end of the runway, and pirouetting to reveal the step-by-step images of Graham\u2019s series, unfolding on their backs.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>It\u2019s not the first time&nbsp;Kriemler has mined a variety of artsy influences for his&nbsp;minimalist designs. In the past, he\u2019s looked to the eco-friendly work of&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/news.artnet.com\/art-world\/albert-kriemlers-sou-fujimoto-collaboration-479327\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">architect&nbsp;Sou Fujimoto<\/a>, as well as, most recently, the abstract paintings of 102-year-old Cuban painter Carmen Herrera.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Graham is definitely on trend, however: The artist\u2019s career retrospective came to the&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.balticmill.com\/whats-on\/exhibitions\/rodney-graham\" target=\"_blank\">BALTIC Centre for Contemporary Art<\/a>&nbsp;in England earlier this year in the wake of the Hauser &amp; Wirth show, and arrives in at&nbsp;the&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.imma.ie\/en\/page_237206.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Irish Museum of Modern Art<\/a>&nbsp;in Dublin in November.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Follow&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/facebook.com\/artnetnews\" target=\"_blank\">artnet News<\/a>&nbsp;on Facebook.<\/em><\/p>\r\n",
