He is looking for someone to pretend to be a passenger.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>He finds a willing taker. He pretends to collect the customer and drop her at the airport. In fact, they never meet. Then he goes online and sends her the agreed fee: about $1.60 (\u00a31.20).<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Or perhaps the driver goes a step further, making up the other person as well as the journey. He goes to the online marketplace Taobao, and buys a hacked smartphone.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>That lets him create multiple fake identities. He uses one to arrange a ride with himself.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Why? Because someone's willing to pay him to give people lifts in his car.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Rational economic incentives<\/h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Investors in Uber and their rivals have run up billions of dollars of losses - in China, and elsewhere - paying people to share car journeys.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Naturally, they're trying to stamp out the imaginary journeys, but they're convinced subsidising genuine rides is a smart idea.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>This all seems bizarre, perverse, even. But everyone involved is rationally pursuing economic incentives.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>To see what's going on, we have to understand a phenomenon that's spawned many buzzwords: \"crowd-based capitalism\", \"collaborative consumption\", \"the sharing economy\", \"the trust economy\".<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/programmes\/p04b1g3c\">50 Things That Made the Modern Economy<\/a>&nbsp;highlights the inventions, ideas and innovations which have helped create the economic world in which we live.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is broadcast on the BBC World Service. You can find&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/programmes\/p059zb6n\">more information about the programme's sources<\/a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/programmes\/p059zb6n\">listen online<\/a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/programmes\/p04b1g3c\/episodes\/downloads\">subscribe to the programme podcast<\/a>.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<hr \/>\r\n<p>Suppose I'm about to drive myself from downtown Shanghai to the airport. I occupy only one seat in my car.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now suppose you live a block away, and you also need to catch a flight. Why don't I give you a lift? You could pay me a modest sum, less than you'd pay for some other mode of transport. You're better off. I'm better off.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are two big reasons why this might not happen. The first, and most obvious, is if neither of us knows the other exists.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h2>'Coincidental wants'<\/h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Until recently, the only way you could advertise your desire for a lift would be to stand at a junction, holding up a sign saying \"airport\". It's not very practical - especially since the plane won't wait.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>This function of matching people who have coincidental wants is among the most powerful ways the internet is reshaping the economy.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Traditional markets work perfectly well for some goods and services, but they're less useful when the goods and services are urgent or obscure.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Consider the plight of Mark Fraser.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was 1995. Mark Fraser gave lots of presentations, and he really wanted a laser pointer - they were new, and cool, but also forbiddingly expensive.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fraser, however, was an electronics geek. He was confident that if he could get his hands on a broken laser pointer, he could fix it.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>But where on earth would he find a broken laser pointer? The answer, now, is obvious - try Taobao, or eBay, or some other online marketplace.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Back then, eBay had only just started. Its very first sale: Mark Fraser bought a broken laser pointer.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mark Fraser was taking a bit of a risk. He didn't know the seller. He simply had to trust that they wouldn't simply pocket his $14.83 (\u00a311.20) then disappear. For other transactions, the stakes are higher.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>That's the second reason I might not give you a lift to Shanghai airport. I've no idea who you are. Perhaps you're planning to attack me and steal my car? You might doubt my motives, too - perhaps I'm a serial killer.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Enablers of trust<\/h2>\r\n\r\n<p>After all, hitch-hiking was a popular pursuit a few decades ago, but fell out of fashion after some well-publicised murders.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trust is an essential component of markets - so essential that we often don't even notice it, like a fish doesn't notice water.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>In developed economies, enablers of trust are everywhere: brands, money-back guarantees, and of course repeat transactions with a seller who can be easily located.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the new sharing economy lacks those enablers. Why should we get into a stranger's car - or buy a stranger's laser pointer?<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1997, eBay introduced a feature that helped solve the problem: Seller Feedback.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to Jim Griffith, eBay's first customer service representative, \"no-one had ever seen anything like [it]\".<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The idea of both parties rating each other after a transaction has become ubiquitous.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>You buy something online - you rate the seller, the seller rates you. You use a lift-sharing service, like Uber - you rate the driver, the driver rates you. You stay in an AirBnB - you rate the host, the host rates you.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>A few positive reviews set our mind at ease about a stranger.
