The institute, slated to open in three years\u2019 time, will consist of a center for studies, diagnostics, and art-historical research. It will also launch a complete online database with information about the artist and his works, as well as an international exhibition program.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The museum and the luxury brand signed a three-year partnership deal with the aim to make the new institute in Rome the go-to point of reference for all things Caravaggio. The initiative comes amid some high-profile controversies over the authenticity of some of his recently discovered works.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The prestigious Galleria Borghese is guardian of some of the most important Caravaggio works in the world, including the&nbsp;<em>Boy with a Basket of Fruit<\/em>(1593-94),&nbsp;<em>Saint Jerome<\/em>&nbsp;(1605), and&nbsp;<em>David with the Head of Goliath&nbsp;<\/em>(1610). In fact, these three works will be exhibited from November 21 at the Getty Museum in Los Angeles\u2014a first step for the new institute\u2019s program\u2014before traveling to East Asia.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although a luxury fashion brand might seem like an unlikely benefactor for a heady art historical research initiative, this is not the first time Fendi has supported Italian cultural patrimony. Over the past few years, the fashion house has shelled out around \u20ac10 million ($12 million) to support major art and heritage projects around the city of Rome, most recently the restoration of the iconic Trevi Fountain in 2015. \u201cIt is increasingly a fundamental value, as well as a moral one, for Fendi to enhance, support, and export Italian art and beauty in the world,\u201d said Pietro Beccari, the label\u2019s CEO, in a statement.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>With \u20ac1.3 million ($1.56 million) in funds from Fendi, the new institute will build a professional digital platform that will include a specialized database with technical documentation to support comparative analyses of works. (Such research includes infrared photographs, stereomicroscope examinations, UVA analysis, and mapping of execution traces.)<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>This centralized think-tank is sorely needed, according to the Galleria Borghese\u2019s director Anna Coliva. \u201cSince the great specialists of Caravaggio are no longer here, anyone can&nbsp;decide to attribute a piece to the artist,\u201d Coliva, who initiated the institute\u2019s creation, said at a press conference on September 13.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Indeed, it was big news when a purported never-before-seen Caravaggio&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/news.artnet.com\/market\/long-lost-caravaggio-found-france-466646\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">was found behind a wall in a house in France<\/a>&nbsp;in 2014. The owner was reportedly investigating a leak when he came across the painting, which has since been valued at \u20ac120 million ($143 million). Some hailed the work as the long-lost companion to Caravaggio\u2019s&nbsp;<em>Judith Beheading Holofernes<\/em>, but&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/news.artnet.com\/market\/painting-found-france-is-caravaggio-472439\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">many, including Coliva, doubt its authenticity<\/a>.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>\u201cYou can see it\u2019s not Caravaggio\u2019s hand,\u201d Coliva says of the painting in a recent interview, \u201cAs he gets more popular and his value increases, I think we will see more Caravaggios coming out of the woodwork.\u201d<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Italian painter is a master of the \u201cchiaroscuro\u201d technique of deep contrasts of light and shadow. He had a turbulent life replete with drinking, womanizing, and fighting (he also may have&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/news.artnet.com\/art-world\/caravaggio-last-two-paintings-971312\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">murdered someone<\/a>), before an untimely death that remains shrouded in mystery.<\/p>\r\n",
